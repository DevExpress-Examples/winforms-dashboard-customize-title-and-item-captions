# WinForms Dashboard - How to customize the dashboard title and dashboard item captions


This example demonstrates how to use the <a href="https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/DevExpress.DashboardWin.DashboardViewer.CustomizeDashboardTitle">DashboardViewer.CustomizeDashboardTitle</a> and <a href="https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/DevExpress.DashboardWin.DashboardViewer.CustomizeDashboardItemCaption">DashboardViewer.CustomizeDashboardItemCaption</a> events to modify the text and toolbar items contained in the <a href="https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/15618/creating-dashboards/creating-dashboards-in-the-winforms-designer/dashboard-layout/dashboard-title">dashboard title area</a>  and <a href="https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/15620/creating-dashboards/creating-dashboards-in-the-winforms-designer/dashboard-layout/dashboard-item-caption">dashboard item captions</a>, respectively.

The dashboard title displays the dimensions and values by which the dashboard data is filtered. You can use a drop-down menu to selectively hide dashboard item captions. Clicking a custom Support button navigates to this example online.

A dashboard item caption displays the master filter values applied using that item.

Export buttons are hidden for all dashboard items except the map, and for the entire dashboard, if the Category contains "Bikes".
